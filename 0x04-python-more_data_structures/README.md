# List Of All The Programs In The Project

### 0-square_matrix_simple.py
Contains the function `square_matrix_simple` which takes a matrix as it's argument, squares all the elements in the matrix and then returns the resulting matrix without modifying the original matrix in the process.

### 1-search_replace.py
Searches for and replaces every occurrence of an element in a list with another specified element.

### 2-uniq_add.py
Adds up all the integers in a list (once for each integer) and returns the result.

### 3-common_elements.py
Returns a set containing elements common to the sets `set_1` and `set_2` passed into it.

### 4-only_diff_elements.py
Returns a set containing elements which are not common to `set_1` and `set_2`.

### 5-number_keys.py
returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

### 6-print_sorted_dictionary.py
prints out the contents of a dictionary by ordered keys.

### 7-update_dictionary.py
updates the contents of a dictionary.

### 8-simple_delete.py
deletes an element from the dictionary through the use of the key.

### 9-multiply_by_2.py
creates a new dictionary by multiplying the values in the dictionary by `2` and returns the newly created dictionary.

### 10-best_score.py
searches through a dictionary of students' scores for the student with the best score and then returns the name of the student.

### 11-multiply_list_map.py
contains the function `multiply_list_map` which takes a list and an integer as it's argument and then returns a new list formed by multiplying each element in the original list by the specified integer `number`.

### 12-roman_to_int.py
contains the function `roman_to_int` which takes a string representing a roman numeral, converts it into it's equivalent integer (Arabic numeral) number and returns the resulting number. returns `0` if the  argument passed is not a string or is `None`.

### 100-weight_average.py
contains the function `weight_average` which takes a list of tuples as it's argument and then calculates the weighted average of all the numbers in the list of tuples, and then returns the result. returns `0` if the list is empty.

### 101-square_matrix_map.py
contains the function `square_matrix_map` which takes a 2D list of elements and returns a new 2D list of elements which is formed by obtaining the square of each of the elements in the original 2D list of elements. The original 2D list will remain unmodified.
